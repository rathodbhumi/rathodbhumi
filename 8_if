# 1. Write a program that asks user to enter a city name and it should tell which country the city belongs to
      city=input("Enter City ")
      if city in india:
          print("The city is in India")
      elif city in pakistan:
          print("The city is in Pakistan")
      elif city in bangladesh:
          print("The city is in Bangladesh")
      else:
          print("Please enter valid city name")

  #(ii)Write a program that asks user to enter two cities and it tells you if they both are in same country or not. For example if I enter mumbai and chennai, it will print "Both cities are in India" but if I enter mumbai and dhaka it should print "They don't belong to same country"
            
            city1=input("Enter first City ")
            city2=input("Enter second City ")
            if city1 and city2 in india:
                print("Both cities are in India" )
            elif city1 and city2 in pakistan:
                print("Both cities are in India" )
            elif city1 and city2 in bangladesh:
                print("Both cities are in India" )
                
            else:
                print("They don't belong to same country")


    # 2. Write a python program that can tell you if your sugar is normal or not. Normal fasting level sugar range is 80 to 100.

            sugar=float(input("enter your fasting sugar level"))
            if sugar<80:
                print("Sugar is low")
            elif sugar>100:
                print("sugar is high")
            else: 
                print ("Sugar is normal")
