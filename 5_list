# 1. Create a list to store these monthly expenses and using that find out,
monthly_expense={'January': 2200,
'February':2350,
'March':2600,
'April':2130,
'May':2190}
print(monthly_expense)

# (i)In Feb, how many dollars you spent extra compare to January?
exp=[2200,2350,2600,2130,2190]
print("Extra expense: ",exp[1]-exp[0])

# (ii)Find out your total expense in first quarter (first three months) of the year.
total_exp=exp[0]+exp[1]+exp[2]
print("Total expense in first quarter: ",total_exp)

#(iii) Find out if you spent exactly 2000 dollars in any month
print("spent exactly 2000 dollars in any month:", 2000 in exp)

#(iv) June month just finished and your expense is 1980 dollar. Add this item to our monthly expense list
exp.append(1980)

#(v) You returned an item that you bought in a month of April and got a refund of 200$. Make a correction to your monthly expense list
based on this
refund=exp[3]-200
exp[3]=refund
print(exp)

# 2. Length of the list
