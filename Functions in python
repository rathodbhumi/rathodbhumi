# 1. Write a function called calculate_area that takes base and height as an input and returns and area of a triangle. Equation of an area of a triangle is,area = (1/2)*base*height
def calculate_area(base, height):
    area = (1/2) * base * height
    return area


b =int(input("Enter base: "))
h =int(input("Enter height: "))
triangle_area = calculate_area(b, h)
print(f"The area of triangle with base {b} and height {h} is: {triangle_area}")

# 2. Modify above function to take third parameter shape type. It can be either "triangle" or "rectangle". Based on shape type it will calculate area. Equation of rectangle's area is,rectangle area=length*width
def calculate_area(base, height,shape):
